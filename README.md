# James Johnson - Professional Portfolio Website

A modern, dual-mode portfolio website showcasing technical skills and creative work. Features a unique toggle system that allows visitors to switch between a Technical/Resume view and a Creative Portfolio view with a smooth 3D flip animation.

## 🌟 Features

### Dual Mode System
The website operates in two distinct modes:

- **Technical Mode (Default)**: Professional resume-style layout with a dark, technical color palette. Highlights cybersecurity and software engineering skills, projects, and experience.

- **Creative Mode**: Lighter, expressive design with creative typography. Showcases creative projects, film production work, and multimedia experience.

### Key Features
- **3D Flip Animation**: Smooth card-flip transition when switching between modes
- **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for all device sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- **Accessible**: Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
- **SEO-Friendly**: Proper meta tags and semantic structure
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight, fast-loading, no external dependencies (except Google Fonts)
- **Mode Persistence**: Remembers user's preferred mode using localStorage

## 🏗️ How It Works

### Architecture
The website uses a card-flip system where both modes exist simultaneously in the DOM. The JavaScript toggles visibility and positioning to create a seamless transition:

1. **Technical Mode Card**: Positioned relatively when active, absolutely when hidden
2. **Creative Mode Card**: Positioned absolutely when hidden, relatively when active
3. **Flip Animation**: CSS transitions handle the smooth opacity and position changes
4. **Mode Toggle Button**: Located in the navbar, updates icon and text based on current mode

### Navigation
- Fixed navbar with smooth scrolling to sections
- Active section highlighting as you scroll
- Mode toggle button with attention animation on page load

### Sections

1. **Hero Section**: Name, title, tagline, and call-to-action buttons
2. **About Me**: Personal introduction, education, and key strengths
3. **Skills**: Organized by category (Programming, OS, Security, Networking, Tools)
4. **Projects**: Detailed project cards with tech stack and descriptions
5. **Experience**: Professional roles and volunteer work
6. **Contact**: Email, LinkedIn, and GitHub links
